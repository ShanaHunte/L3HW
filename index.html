	   <div><h1>CLINTEASTWOOD & MORGANFREEMAN</h1><p>Man's gotta know his limitations. dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy. what you have to ask yourself is, do i feel lucky. well do ya' punk? it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world. are you feeling lucky punk cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. you see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig. you dig. this is the ak-47 assault rifle, the preferred weapon of your enemy; and it makes a distinctive sound when fired at you, so remember it. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. when a naked man's chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher knife and a hard-on, i figure he's not out collecting for the red cross. bruce... i'm god.</p>

	   <h2>Well, what is it today?</h2><p> more spelunking? you want a guarantee, buy a toaster. well, do you have anything to say for yourself? boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. man's gotta know his limitations. are you feeling lucky punk multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. this is my gun, clyde! rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. this is the ak-47 assault rifle, the preferred weapon of your enemy; and it makes a distinctive sound when fired at you, so remember it. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered.</p>
